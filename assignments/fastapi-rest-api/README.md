# 📘 Assignment: Building REST APIs with FastAPI

## 🎯 Objective

Learn how to build and test RESTful APIs using the FastAPI framework in Python. Students will create endpoints, handle requests, and return JSON responses.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Task 1: FastAPI Setup & Hello World

#### Description
Set up a basic FastAPI project and create a simple endpoint that returns a welcome message.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:
- Install FastAPI and Uvicorn
- Create a FastAPI app with a `/` endpoint
- Return a JSON response with a welcome message

### 🛠️ Task 2: Create CRUD Endpoints

#### Description
Implement RESTful endpoints for managing a list of items (e.g., books, tasks, or users) in memory.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:
- Provide endpoints for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations
- Use Python data structures to store items
- Return appropriate JSON responses for each operation

### 🛠️ Task 3: API Testing

#### Description
Write simple tests to verify your API endpoints using Python's `requests` library or FastAPI's built-in testing tools.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:
- Include test cases for each endpoint
- Check for correct status codes and response data
- Demonstrate how to run the tests
